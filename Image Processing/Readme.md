### Why HSV?
Unlike RGB which is defined in relation to primary colors, HSV is defined in a way that is similar to how humans perceive color.
For our application, the major advantage of using the HSV color space is that the color/tint/wavelength is represented by just the Hue component.
So when I say, I need a particular color and select the hue component then depending on the saturation component I get different shades of that color and further depending on the value component I get different Intensities of a particular shade of the color.

## How to find HSV values to track?
    >>> green = np.uint8([[[0,255,0 ]]])
    >>> hsv_green = cv2.cvtColor(green,cv2.COLOR_BGR2HSV)
    >>> print(hsv_green)
    [[[ 60 255 255]]]
Now you take [H-10, 100,100] and [H+10, 255, 255] as lower bound and upper bound respectively. Apart from this method, you can use any image editing tools like GIMP or any online converters to find these values, but donâ€™t forget to adjust the HSV ranges.

hsv_green : [[[ 60 255 255]]]
hsv_blue : [[[120 255 255]]]
hsv_red : [[[  0 255 255]]]
